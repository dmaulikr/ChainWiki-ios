# ChainChronicleKoreaWiki

## Synopsis
iOS App that uses data translated from Japanese in Korean.
Allows users to sort and filter data based on their needs.

2. Korean text is uploaded to Firebase for quick and instant access of Korean text.
3. Users instantly access understandable data from their iOS device.
4. Users sort or filter data through Firebase or in-app commands. 
5. Users edit and improve the data for other users.
