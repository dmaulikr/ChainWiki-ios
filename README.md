## Synopsis
iOS App that uses data translated from Japanese in Korean.  
Allows users to sort and filter data based on their needs.  
Developed independently from scratch.  
Compatible with both iPhone and iPad through Auto Layout.
1000 records fetched by script.

## How it Works
1. Japanese web content is retrieved and translated using Google Translate API which returns JSON.
2. JSON is parsed and the korean text is uploaded to Firebase for quick and instant future access of Korean text.
3. Users instantly access understandable data from their iOS device.
4. Users sort or filter data through Firebase or in-app commands. 
5. Users edit, improve, or export the data for other users.
